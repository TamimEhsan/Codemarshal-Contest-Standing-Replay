# Codemarshal Contest Standing Replay
After each contest I had to speculate how were our performance througout the whole time. As codemarshal doesn't have any 
timeline feature so it was kinda difficult to estimate. So, I made this.

## How to use
Goto [Codemarshal Contest timeline](https://tamimehsan.github.io/Codemarshal-Contest-Standing-Replay/)
And you'll find something like this.

You can view ICPC 2021 Dhaka Regionals final which is already loaded. Or you can do replay anyone by doing the following steps

- Goto a contest page in codemarshal
- Goto Standings
- Inspect page
- Copy the whole source code or HTML page from the inspect tab
- Paste it in a txt file in your pc
- Go to my site
- Browse and open the txt
- Wait a bit to load the file (The page will have the final standings then)
- After the file is loaded into memory press start
